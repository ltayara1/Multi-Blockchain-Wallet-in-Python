# Multi-Blockchain Wallet in Python

## Background

This project builds a system that can create an HD wallet as a portfolio management system that supports not only traditional assets like gold, silver, stocks, etc, but crypto-assets as well. Once I've integrated this "universal" wallet, I used Ethereum and Bitcoin Testnet.

### Use
This python wallet has the potential to manage billions of addresses across 300+ coins, giving you a serious edge against the competition.

The process includes:
- Generate a mnemonic
- Derive the wallet keys
- Link the transaction-signing libraries
